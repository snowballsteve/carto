    Description:
      Abstract:
        This map layer shows major ports in the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.  A 
        port is a city, town, or urban area with a harbor where ships load or unload.  This is a revised 
        version of the July 2012 map layer.
      Purpose: 
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large 
        regional areas.  The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate 
        for 1:1,000,000-scale data.  No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United 
        States in the use of these data.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description: 
          The ports were downloaded from the NTAD as a feature class.  Additional ports were added from 
          GNIS_PORTS by selecting all harbor features with "Port" in the name.  The resulting GNIS feature 
          selections were checked against DOQs and topographic maps to make sure they were actually port 
          sites.  

          To identify groups of port sites, each urban center that contained port sites was buffered by 10 
          miles, and GNIS ports within the 10-mile buffer were assigned to that urban center.  The selected 
          port sites were then buffered and merged by urban area, and a centroid was created for each 
          merged port-site area. This resulted in 125 sites representative of both NTAD and GNIS harbor 
          urban groupings.

          Groupings of NTAD sites were reviewed and assigned to urban centers, if they were not already 
          assigned in the step above.

          The US Army Corps of Engineers report, including the Mississippi River System inland port map, 
          was used to ensure that all major inland ports were represented.  If an inland port was listed in 
          this document, and was not in GNIS or the NTAD, a point was placed in the harbor using the 
          nearest city location and an online DOQ.

          Port positions were adjusted to more accurately reflect actual port locations; locations were

          Aerial, Bing Maps Road, National Geographic World Map, World Street Map, and the USA Topographic 
          Maps.  Several ports were deleted.  The map layer was saved in shapefile and in file geodatabase 
          formats.
