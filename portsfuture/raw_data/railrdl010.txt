    Description:
      Abstract:
        This map layer includes railroads in the conterminous United States and
        Alaska.
      Purpose:
        These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the
        national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be
        displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:1,000,000-scale data.  
        No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States 
        in the use of these data.

              Numerous sources were used to perform quality-control and vertical 
              integration, including all the 1:1,000,000-scale National Atlas 
              map layers, a variety of online sources, and online USGS 
              topographic maps.  More information is available from the National

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          The Railway Network data were loaded and the attributes were edited to 
          include a maximum of three railroad owner names and their 
          corresponding reporting marks.  Abandoned railroads and rail lines no 
          longer in existence were identified and deleted.  The attributes were 
          reorganized, so that for tracks with multiple owners, the largest 
          railroad is listed as Rrowner1, the next smaller railroad is listed 
          as Rrowner2, and the smallest of the three railroads, if any, is 
          listed as Rrowner3.  Some tracks were adjusted inland from open water 
          using Atlas_States as a guide.  Tracks were generalized, particularly 
          in congested areas, and merged where they run closely parallel to one 
          another.  The file was saved as a Shapefile.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          The data were converted to an Albers Equal Area projection.  Attribute 
          fields for miles and kilometers were added, and the values were 
          calculated using ArcGIS.  The data were then converted back to 
          geographic coordinates.

      Process_Step:
        Process_Description:
          All the 1:1,000,000-scale map layers were checked for vertical 
          integration.  Line positions were adjusted as necessary to remove 
          overlaps.  Wherever possible, linear features were separated by 300 
          meters, but were kept within 500 meters of their true location.
